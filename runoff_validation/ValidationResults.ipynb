    "# Validation results \n",
    "These are the numerical results obtained by running the synthetic runoff test cases given in Fernandez et al (2016). The test cases consider shallow water flow on a terrain given a rain pattern, infiltration formula, friction and runoff from the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The three test cases consider:\n",
    "* Runoff from a sloping domain after 5 different rain events\n",
    "* Runoff from a sloping domain with a water trap\n",
    "* Runoff and infiltration of water from a sloping terrain with many water traps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some details will be given below, but for the full details and the reference results, please see the original paper by Fernandez-Pato et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run it, use the `double_test_runoff.jl` script in this folder. The name \"double\" refers to double precision, as it was required to pass the test. See the discussion about this in `docs/shallow_water_equations.ipynb`.\n",

    "## Computing runoff volume from the domain:\n",
    "Runoff is the integrated flux over the boundary of the domain of interest. One way to compute it is to add up all the fluxes across the boundary faces, which is not straight forward given that the computational core is on GPU, and would also lead to a performance penality, and non-general code in the computational kernel. Furthermore, the boundary conditions at this open boundary must also be implemented such that we don't get any reflecting waves back into our domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we consider runoff by extending the computational boundary with a sloping pool that catches all the water that leaves the domain of interest. We furthermore ensure that there is no infiltration or rain in this pool, and that it has wall boundary conditions. This means that the volume of the trapped water in the pool at any given time is the runoff until that moment."
